## Synopsis.
#### In February of 2015, airline carriers at various airports were logged by their different types of delays: late arrivals, weather, security, cancellations, diverted flights, etc.  Our data shows the number of events as well as the total time lost due to the different types of delays.  

```{r echo=FALSE}

## step 1:  make the data tidy.  melt the df and recast matching one observation per row.
flights <- melt(flydata, id=c("year","month","carrier","carrier_name","airport","airport_name"))
